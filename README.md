Short / Social I built an interactive periodic table using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript — responsive layout, animated hover effects, and clickable element cards that open a detailed popup with keyboard-friendly close (Esc). Great little demo for learning UI/UX and DOM interactions. Feedback welcome!

Medium / Engaging (recommended) Proud to share a small frontend project: an interactive periodic table built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

What it does

Clickable element tiles that open a styled popup with atomic number, mass and a short description
Smooth hover animations and scale effects for an engaging UI
Overlay + keyboard (Esc) support for accessible modal closing
Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
Why I built it

Practice composing flexible CSS layouts and animations
Create a neat visual tool for students and anyone curious about the elements
A portfolio piece demonstrating DOM manipulation without frameworks
If you'd like the code, a walkthrough, or suggestions for adding features (search, filters, keyboard navigation, ARIA improvements), I’d be happy to share.

Technical / Dev-Focused Released an interactive periodic-table demo (HTML/CSS/vanilla JS). Implementation highlights:

Modular tile layout across left / center / right / bottom regions with CSS flex and absolute positioning for complex grid mimicry
Tile hover transition: scale + gradient + z-index to create focused element previews
Modal popup with overlay and Esc key handling for keyboard accessibility
Lightweight: zero dependencies, easy to extend with JSON-driven data, search, or ARIA roles for improved accessibility
Planned next steps: convert element data into a JSON file, add search/filter, and introduce full keyboard/ARIA accessibility. Want a PR-ready repo or feature suggestions? Ping me.

If you want, I can:

Tailor one of these to a specific audience (hiring managers, recruiters, teachers)
Add a short intro sentence for an image/video/attached GIF of the project
Draft a GitHub README or tweet-sized announcement to pair with the post
